Each method aims to remould the clay with the same optimum moisture content (OMC) and density. The Proctor compaction method is considered the baseline for comparison. The results of the experiment will reveal the unconfined shear strength and strain for each method, as well as the percentage reduction in shear strength compared to the Proctor compaction method. The team must decide which method is most suitable for forming remoulded clay samples based on factors such as ease of use, time efficiency, and energy consumption. The chosen method will be recommended for future researchers to use in their studies of remoulded clay's shear strength.\\n\\nClues:\\nIf the hand operated soil compactor is chosen, then the method must be more time efficient than the Proctor compaction\\nIf the miniature mould is chosen, then the energy consumption must be less than the Proctor compaction\\nThe Proctor compaction method cannot be chosen if there is a method that results in both higher time efficiency and lower energy consumption\\n\\nQ: Which of the following could be a reason for the research team to choose a specific moulding method?\\n(A) The hand operated soil compactor is less time efficient than the Proctor compaction\\n(B) The miniature mould consumes more energy than the Proctor compaction\\n(C) The hand operated soil compactor is more time efficient than the Proctor compaction\\n(D) The Proctor compaction is chosen despite another method being both more time efficient and consuming less energy\\n(E) The miniature mould consumes less energy than the Proctor compaction\"}, {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"(C) The hand operated soil compactor is more time efficient than the Proctor compaction\\n\\nThis could be a reason for the research team to choose the hand operated soil compactor over the Proctor compaction method, as it meets the condition that if the hand operated soil compactor is chosen, it must be more time efficient than the Proctor compaction. This would satisfy one of the criteria for selecting a method based on time efficiency.\\n\\n(E) The miniature mould consumes less energy than the Proctor compaction\\n\\nThis could also be a reason for the research team to choose the miniature mould method over the Proctor compaction method, as it meets the condition that if the miniature mould is chosen, then the energy consumption must be less than the Proctor compaction.
